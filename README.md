# Python-Algorithms-and-Data-Structures
Portfolio projects involving the use of algorithms and data structures in python as a tool to solve problems and create interesting programs. 

## Word Game with Parallel Processing
The primary goal of this project is to transform one word into another of the same length, changing only one letter at a time, then return the connecting chain of words. The project utilizes graph theory, queues/deques, breadth-first search algorithms, and multiprocessing techniques.
