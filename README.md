# Python-Algorithms-and-Data-Structures
Portfolio projects involving the use of algorithms and data structures in python as a tool to solve problems and create interesting programs. 

## Word Game with Parallel Processing
This project, developed over the summer of 2023, focuses on data structures and algorithms. The primary goal is to transform one word into another of the same length, changing only one letter at a time, then return the connecting chain of words. The project utilizes graph theory, queues, breadth-first search algorithms, and multiprocessing techniques.
